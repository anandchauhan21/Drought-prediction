# Drought-prediction
Drought is a serious climatic condition that affects
nearly all climatic zones worldwide. so the goal of this project was to predict the next monthly Drought with the technology of TensorFlow, in this project I use google earth engine's data call "NOAA/CDR/AVHRR/SR/V5" which is the gives us the data of surface reflection from 1981-06-24 to current data, with this data on mind I have to calculate the standardized precipitation index SPI that what quantifies the drought itself but the biggest issue I face in this project is the shortage of python API support for gathering the data because the python API for google earth engine is still in research face and the all the function are in javascript form but I still manage to gather the data and accomplish the task and using meteorological data and vegetation indices from satellite data and projects were developed for quantifying
drought conditions. the key factor that I learn form it is how to work with google earth engine API, calculation SPI for monthly bases, and how to use python and TensorFlow to predict the future drought condition.
